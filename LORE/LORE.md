# Timeline

A general flow of events for my alternate timeline. This is in development and may change at any moment.

The "Rank" number in the aircraft descriptions places each machine in an era.

## Rank I

Start: N/A

### Politics

The traditional world. A worsening climate and political scene lead to a massive war. For the first time, corporations are targeted. Few players of the old world survive the conflict.

This battle was fought primarily with unprotected soldiers and the primitive automation of the time, contributing to mass casualties.

## Rank II

Start: 2020s

### Politics

In the wake of the war, regional governments formed and the countries mostly put aside their differences. A new global organization was formed to ensure this peace would last. The **Coalition** was started.

However, some were against this. A then-unknown force carried out a coordinated attack on disputed territories and strategic locations from the old world. The strength of the alliance was tested by the **separatists**.

Fortunately, the countries were quick to realize that their new allies had not betrayed them. The separatist force was pushed back.

To exploit the economic gains and technological advancement of war, the new corporations deliberately prevented the obliberation of the separatist force, and convinced forces of the Coalition to conduct a long, drawn-out war.

### Economics

The old corporations that formed military industrial complex mostly faded into obscurity. In their place, hundreds of small technological startups fought to fill every gap left by the giants of old.

### Technology

The public's rising distrust for military automation and guided weapons, and the new military scene's aversion towards mutually assured destruction, lead to severe restrictions on many types of automated and long-range weaponry. Groups that used or manufactured such weapons would risk economic sanctions by the Coalition and other companies.

Even with technological developments in other sectors, the abandonment of military automation is said to have delayed humanity's advancement by a hundred years.
