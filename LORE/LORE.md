# Timeline

A general flow of events for my alternate timeline. This is in development and may change at any moment.

The "Rank" number in the aircraft descriptions places each machine in an era.

## Rank I

Start: N/A

### Politics

The traditional world. A worsening climate and political scene lead to a massive war. For the first time, corporations are targeted. Few players of the old world survive the conflict.

This battle was fought primarily with unprotected soldiers and the primitive automation of the time, contributing to mass casualties.

## Rank II

Start: 2020s

### Politics

In the wake of the war, regional governments formed and the countries mostly put aside their differences. A new global organization was formed to ensure this peace would last. The **Coalition** was started.

However, some were against this. A then-unknown force carried out a coordinated attack on disputed territories and strategic locations from the old world. The strength of the alliance was tested by the **separatists**.

Fortunately, the countries were quick to realize that their new allies had not betrayed them. The separatist force was pushed back.

To exploit the economic gains and technological advancement of war, the new corporations deliberately prevented the obliberation of the separatist force, and convinced forces of the Coalition to conduct a long, drawn-out war. Intense fighting lasted a few years, but quickly turned into guerrila warfare against technologically inferior enemies. This was tedious and yielded little benefits.

### Economics

The old corporations that formed military industrial complex mostly faded into obscurity. In their place, hundreds of small technological startups fought to fill every gap left by the giants of old.

New arms manufacturers formed, some funded by their home governments, while most conducted their operations independently from any organization.

### Technology

The public's rising distrust for military automation and guided weapons, and the new military scene's aversion towards mutually assured destruction, lead to severe restrictions on many types of automated and long-range weaponry. Groups that used or manufactured such weapons would risk economic sanctions by the Coalition and other companies. Manufacturers hence turned towards the older concepts of armor and maneuverability.

Even with technological developments in other sectors, the abandonment of military automation is said to have delayed humanity's advancement by a hundred years.

The war against the separatists did produce technological gains, but only temporarily.

## Rank III

Start: 2040s

### Politics

The battle against the separatist forces became a place for arms manufacturers to show off their latest developments. While it was a realistic combat scenario, it was low-risk.

Additionally, public interest in the war had waned. Many doubted the continued existence of hidden enemy forces, suggesting that they were fakes posted by the companies in the Coalition. Others viewed the war as inhumane, as an attempt to eradicate the communities that are now just fighting for survival.

The war was mostly stopped, and increased surveillance was conducted to prevent attacks by the former separatists. The fears of being attacked continued, and as such, governments and companies alike stocked up on weapons. A new arms race had begun. 

### Economics

Some new age companies had grown into billion-dollar entities.

One major arms manufacturer was ASTIND. The American company built machines for every type of combat environment. Successful designs and the aggressive acquisition of smaller companies made it one of the fastest-growing manufacturers in the early 21st Century.

A rising manufacturer was HAMEKA. The Japanese manufacturer is most well-known for its highly advanced mechanical military designs, but also operates in the industrial and healthcare sectors. Through a deal with ASTIND, HAMEKA machines are sold under ASTIND designations in Europe and the Americas for some time.

### Technology

New chemical and material advancements pushed aircraft performance. The human body managed to be pushed slightly further, but remained a limiting factor for maneuverability.

Combat walkers and other humanoid machines started to catch on, but were unviable due to costs and their inherent weaknesses.

Piloting aids automated most operation processes, making the use of both civilian and military machines more accessible. This technology became very reliable and meant that clunky button panels could be removed.
