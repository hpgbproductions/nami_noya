# Timeline

A general flow of events for my alternate timeline. This is in development and may change at any moment.

The "Rank" number in the aircraft descriptions places each machine in an era.

## Rank I

Start: N/A

The traditional world. A worsening climate and political scene lead to a massive war. For the first time, corporations are targeted. Few players of the old world survive the conflict.

This battle was fought primarily with unprotected soldiers and the primitive automation of the time, contributing to mass casualties.

## Rank II

Start: 2020s
