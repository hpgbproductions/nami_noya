# Biocomputing

## What is Biocomputing?

Biocomputing is a generic term for computing technology that relies on man-made constructions of neurological systems. In terms of hardware, biocomputers are similar to the neurological systems of humans and animals. These computers consist of one or more biological processors, or "brains", connected to numerous input and output devices with "nerves".

## History of Biocomputing

Two areas of science are required for designing biocomputers - the medical knowledge of the neurological system and its workings, and the ability of biotechnology manufacturers to recreate such systems. In the 2010s, the poor development in these two areas meant that biocomputing was limited to simple logic gate and memory devices. Scientific development picked up momentum afterwards, but was quickly stunted and would not recover for decades due to the Reformative War. During the war, multiple large cities using artificial intelligence (AI) management systems were compromised, leading to mass casualties and the complete loss of public services and productivity. In hindsight, this was due to the rudimentary cybersecurity standards of the time. However, the view of AI in the public was very negative at the time, and it caused governments to cut most of their funding to the development of AI technologies and their applications. What little research continued was dedicated to cybersecurity and the maintenance of AI infrastructure that could not be removed, and this technology stagnated around the world.

This would change in the summer of 2055, when the first true biocomputer, the Mark I Rodent Cognitive Replicant (RCR-I), was developed by a well-known British university. The RCR-I was a non-living recreation of a rat's brain and central nervous system using biologically-derived materials. Scientists scanned the brain of a rat using a state-of-the-art Leibniz scanning process and constructed a replica using the model they obtained. The resulting biocomputer took up the space of half a room, but it is important to note that the "brain" only took up about 5% of the space in the entire machine. Most of the space was occupied by cooling, protection for the fragile bioprocessors, and other support systems. While its computational power was poor in a pure mathematical sense, the biocomputer could be trained to complete pattern-matching and object recognition tasks that were considered challenging for computing applications in silicon. Subsequent revisions optimized the heat efficiency of bioprocessors and the internal design of the biocomputer, and the research team was able to reduce the size of their fifth machine to that of a typical desktop computer. But how were these studies allowed? It turned out that the British government had managed to avoid inciting public outcry by emphasizing biocomputing research as an avenue into neurological and mental health research. After all, it was true that many important findings about animal behavior and cognitive functions we know today came from simulations using these RCR machines. With neurological machines posed as a tool for healthcare research, and not artificial intelligence, they were easily accepted and biocomputing research continued.
