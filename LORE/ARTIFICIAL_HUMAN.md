## Background

### Biocomputing

Biocomputing is a generic term for computing technology that relies on man-made constructions of neurological systems. Hardware architecture of biocomputers follows the system adopted by most animals, including a "brain" connected to numerous input sensors with "nerves", and sends signals to output sensors. Biocomputing architecture is closely based on two areas of science at any time - the medical knowledge of the neurological system and its workings, and the ability of biotechnology manufacturers to recreate such systems. Due to the poor development in these two areas, biocomputing was limited to recreations of the earliest semiconductor chips in the 2010s. Scientific development picked up momentum afterwards, but was quickly stunted and would not recover for decades due to the Reformative War. During the war, multiple large cities using artificial intelligence (AI) management systems were compromised, leading to mass casualties and the complete loss of public services and productivity. In hindsight, this was due to the rudimentary cybersecurity standards of the time. However, the view of AI in the public was very negative at the time, and it caused governments to cut most of their funding to the development of AI technologies and their applications. What little research continued was dedicated to cybersecurity and the maintenance of AI infrastructure that could not be removed, and this technology stagnated around the world.

This would change in the summer of 2055, when the first true biocomputer, the Mark I Rodent Cognitive Replicant (RCR-I), was developed by a well-known British university. The RCR-I was a non-living recreation of a rat's brain and central nervous system using biologically-derived materials. The biocomputer took up the space of half a room, but the "brain" only took up about 10% of the space in the entire machine. Most of the space was occupied by cooling and other support systems. While its computational power was poor in a pure mathematical sense, the biocomputer could be trained to complete pattern-matching and object recognition tasks that were considered challenging for computing applications in silicon. The British government had managed to avoid provoking the public by posing biocomputing research as an avenue into neurological and mental health research. After all, it was true that many simulations were ran using RCR machines to learn about animal behavior and cognitive functions.
