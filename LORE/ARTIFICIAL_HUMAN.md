## Background

### Biocomputing

Biocomputing is a generic term for computing technology that relies on man-made constructions of neurological systems. Hardware architecture of biocomputers follows the system adopted by most animals, including a "brain" connected to numerous input sensors with "nerves", and sends signals to output sensors. Biocomputing architecture is closely based on two areas of science at any time - the medical knowledge of the neurological system and its workings, and the ability of biotechnology manufacturers to recreate such systems. Due to the poor development in these two areas, biocomputing was limited to recreations of the earliest semiconductor chips in the 2010s. Scientific development picked up momentum afterwards, but was quickly stunted and would not recover for decades as the Reformative War caused governments to suspend research works in artificial intelligence.

According to popular recognition, the first true biocomputer was the RX-001, developed by former NEUROCOM. The RX-001 was a recreation of a rat's brain and central nervous system spanning several rooms.
