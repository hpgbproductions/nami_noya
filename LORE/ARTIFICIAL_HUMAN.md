## Background

### Biocomputing

Biocomputing is a generic term for computing technology that relies on man-made constructions of neurological systems. Hardware architecture of biocomputers follows the system adopted by most animals, including a "brain" connected to numerous input sensors with "nerves", and sends signals to output sensors. Biocomputing architecture is closely based on two areas of science at any time - the medical knowledge of the neurological system and its workings, and the ability of biotechnology manufacturers to recreate such systems. Due to the poor development in these two areas, biocomputing was limited to recreations of the earliest semiconductor chips in the 2010s. Scientific development picked up momentum afterwards, but was quickly stunted and would not recover for decades as the Reformative War caused governments to suspend research works in artificial intelligence.

According to popular recognition, the first true biocomputer was the Mark I Cognitive Replicant, developed by a well-known British university. The Mark I was a non-living recreation of a rat's brain and central nervous system using biologically-derived materials. The biocomputer took up the space of half a room, but the "brain" only took up about 10% of the space in the entire machine. Most of the space was occupied by cooling and other support systems. While its computational power was poor in a pure mathematical sense, the biocomputer could be trained to complete pattern-matching and object recognition tasks that were considered challenging for computing applications in silicon.
